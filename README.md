# Algorithm Configuration Data Mining for CMA Evolution Strategies

This repository contains the data and analysis for the paper [**Algorithm Configuration Data Mining for CMA Evolution Strategies**][2].


## Introduction

The [Python Notebook][3] contains all code that was used to analyse the accompanying pre-processed dataset in the /arff folder.

The original dataset was created using [this repository][7], which builds on top of the [ModEA][4] framework, as published in '[Evolving the Structure of Evolution Strategies][5]'


## Dependencies

This project was written for Python 2.7. All required packages from PyPI are specified in the `requirements.txt`.

*NOTE:* This list of packages includes the `pydot` package, for which [`Graphviz`][6] has to be installed on your operating system. This package is _optional_ to complete the analysis, but is included to visualize the Decision Trees that are created.


## Use

The easiest way to re-run the notebook is to use the [Binder link][1] which will load an online environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository, install the `requirements.txt` and run the notebook locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/sjvrijn/cma-es-configuration-data-mining.git cmaes-config-dm
cd cmaes-config-dm
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
# pip install --user jupyter notebook  # <-- only required if you don't yet have jupyter installed
jupyter notebook
```


## Contact

If there are any questions or issues, please come to the [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/pyModEA/configuring-cmaes) or open an issue here on Github.
